# SOLID

A simple project outlining the SOLID principles.

• Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): This principle states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

• Open/Closed Principle (OCP): This principle suggests that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. It encourages the use of abstraction to allow for adding new functionality without altering existing code.

• Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): This principle emphasizes that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the application's functionality.

• Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): This principle advocates that a client should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. It encourages the creation of many client-specific interfaces instead of one general-purpose interface.

• Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): This principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules but rather on abstractions. It promotes the use of interfaces to decouple classes and improve the flexibility of the codebase.
